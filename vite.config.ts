/**
 * Vite config.
 *
 * This used to be three lines wrapping a vendor package that assembled the
 * plugin list for us. That vendor was the app builder this project started
 * on; we left the platform in August 2026, and its build wrapper was the
 * last thing it still owned. Everything it configured is spelled out below,
 * using the same public plugins it called. The pieces specific to its own
 * sandbox (an HMR gate, a dev-server bridge, an assets proxy, build-error
 * diagnostics, and a forced host/port) are gone rather than reimplemented,
 * because none of them ran outside that sandbox.
 *
 * The settings here are deliberately a faithful transcription rather than
 * an improvement pass. Anything worth changing should change in its own
 * commit, where a regression has one obvious cause.
