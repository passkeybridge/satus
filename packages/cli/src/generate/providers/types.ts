 * Provider abstraction for LLM-backed row generation.

 * Each concrete provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, ...) returns a `Provider`
 * object with a stable `generate()` method. The runner never imports a
 * provider directly — it receives one from the command layer and calls
 * `generate()` per batch. This keeps the runner free of provider-specific
 * HTTP shapes, auth headers, and structured-output quirks.
 *
 * v0.2.0 hardcoded OpenAI; v0.3.0 introduces this interface as a refactor
 * with no behavior change, then adds Anthropic alongside in Pass 3.
