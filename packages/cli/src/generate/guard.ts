/**
 * Production-database safety guard.
 *
 * `satus generate` writes rows. The single mistake most likely to hurt is
 * pointing `DATABASE_URL` at production and finding out afterwards. This
 * module is the one confirmation prompt between a user and that mistake,
 * expressed as a refusal and an exit code rather than an interactive
 * question (the CLI has to work unattended in CI).
 *
 * The rule, as published at https://satus.sh/docs/how-it-works:
 *
 *   Count rows in every table outside pg_catalog, information_schema and
 *   pg_toast. Refuse to run if the total exceeds 10,000. `--force`
 *   bypasses. A guard trip exits 11 (E_DB_NOT_EMPTY) so CI can tell
 *   "refused to run" from "tried and failed".
 *
 * Two things it is deliberately not: a permission check (Postgres roles do
 * that better) and a rollback mechanism (the single transaction does that).
 *
 * ## Why the counting is shaped this way
 *
 * A naive `count(*)` per table is unbounded work on exactly the databases
 * we most want to stop — a production table can be hundreds of millions of
 * rows. But we never need the true total: we only need to know whether it
 * exceeds the threshold. So each table is counted through a subquery capped
 * at threshold+1 rows, and the running total short-circuits as soon as it
 * crosses. On production the first large table trips it and we stop; on a
 * dev database every table is tiny and the full pass is trivial.
 *
 * Planner estimates (pg_class.reltuples) would be free, but they are stale
 * between ANALYZEs and report -1 for a never-analyzed table — which is the
 * exact state of a freshly restored production dump. A safety guard that
 * mis-reads a restored production database as empty is worse than no
 * guard, so this counts real rows.

 *
 * Foreign tables ('f') are excluded too — counting one reaches out to
