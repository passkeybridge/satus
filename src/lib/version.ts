/**
 * Canonical version constants for the satus.sh marketing surface.

 * Update these in one place when a new CLI release lands. The TopBar build
 * tag, the LeftRail "Document" block, the /cli reference header, the
 * /quickstart sample output, and any other version-bearing copy import from
 * here so the site cannot drift from the published npm package.
 *
 * Source of truth for the binary itself lives in
 * packages/cli/src/version.ts; keep these two in sync at release time.
