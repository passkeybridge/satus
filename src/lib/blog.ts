/**
 * Blog content loader.
 *
 * Posts live as `.md` files under `src/content/blog/` and are bundled at
 * build time via the `virtual:blog-posts` module
 * (scripts/vite-plugin-blog-posts.ts). No filesystem reads at runtime,
 * Cloudflare Workers safe.
 *
 * Production builds only ever see publishable posts: the plugin drops
 * `draft: true` posts and posts whose `publishAt` is after the build instant
 * before bundling. This module is reachable from client routes, so anything
 * it imports ships in public JS; until 2026-09-26 it globbed the whole
 * folder and the full markdown of unpublished posts was readable in the
 * browser bundle. An embargoed post goes live on the first build after its
 * `publishAt` (.github/workflows/scheduled-publish.yml triggers one).
 *
 * Frontmatter contract is documented in `src/content/blog/README.md`.
 * Validation is intentionally strict, and is enforced in two places:
 *
 *   - `scripts/validate-blog.mjs` runs before `vite build` and fails the
 *     deploy. This is where a malformed post is meant to be caught.
 *   - `parsePost` below re-validates at runtime; a post that somehow fails
 *     here is skipped with a console error rather than thrown, so it can
 *     never take the whole site down (see the POSTS comment).
 *
 * Until 2026-08-10 this comment claimed malformed posts were "a build-time
 * error, not a runtime surprise". They were exactly the opposite: the
 * check lived only inside parsePost, which `vite build` never evaluates.
 *
 * Frontmatter parsing is intentionally hand-rolled. The third-party
 * gray-matter package depends on Node's Buffer global, which is absent in
 * the browser bundle and stubbed unevenly in the Worker runtime. Our
 * frontmatter dialect is a tiny, controlled subset of YAML (scalars,
 * inline arrays, booleans, ISO dates), so a 30-line parser is both safer
 * and a smaller dependency surface for acquisition review.
