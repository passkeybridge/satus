/**
 * /terms—Terms of Service for satus.sh.
 *
 * Adapted from the PasskeyBridge LLC master terms to the narrower satus.sh
 * surface: a CLI that generates Postgres seed data, a marketing site, a
 * Stripe-backed license-verification API, and a license-delivery email.
 * Single contact mailbox (support@satus.sh) for v1; dpo@ stays under the
 * parent company until satus.sh scales enough to warrant a dedicated DPO
 * channel.
 *
 * Kept as plain prose with §-numbered sections to match the rest of the
 * site's technical-spec aesthetic. No JSON-LD—Google does not index legal
 * pages as rich results and the markup overhead is wasted.

            satus is a command-line tool that reads the schema of a Postgres database and produces
            realistic, relationally-coherent seed data. It runs entirely on your own infrastructure,
            against databases you control. The Service consists of:
          </p>
          <ul className="ml-5 list-disc space-y-1">
            <li>The satus CLI binary, distributed via npm and Homebrew.</li>
            <li>The satus.sh marketing site, blog, and documentation.</li>
            <li>A license-verification API at <code>/api/public/license/verify</code>.</li>
            <li>A transactional email that delivers your license key after purchase.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            satus is <em>not</em> a hosted database, a managed AI service, an analytics platform, or
            a data-processing pipeline. We do not see, store, or transmit the rows the CLI generates
            on your machine.

            Subject to payment of the applicable fees, PasskeyBridge grants you a limited,
            non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to install and use the satus CLI on
            machines under your control. Each license key is bound to a single named seat. You may
            not share your license key, resell it, embed it in a public repository, or use it to
            provide the satus functionality as a hosted service to third parties.

            satus requires an API key from a supported LLM provider (OpenAI at launch; Anthropic
            and Google in 0.2) to generate column-level values. You are responsible for:

              Treating the API key as a secret. satus reads the key from the environment and never

          </ul>
          <p>
            We are not a sub-processor for your LLM provider. Prompts and completions flow directly
            from your machine to the provider; we never see them.
