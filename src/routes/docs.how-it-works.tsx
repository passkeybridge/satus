            Every <code>satus generate</code> run makes three promises to your
            database. They aren&rsquo;t marketing copy—they map directly to
            three pieces of code in the CLI, and each one has a named exit code
            you can branch on in CI.

              <strong>The FK-cycle planner</strong> reorders inserts so every
              foreign key points at a row that already exists, even when your

          <p>
            Postgres lets you declare foreign keys in any topology, including
            cycles—<code>users.primary_org_id → organizations.id</code> and{" "}
            <code>organizations.owner_id → users.id</code> is the textbook
            example, but the pattern shows up anywhere a graph has bidirectional
            ownership (folders ↔ root_file, accounts ↔ default_card, threads ↔
            latest_message). It compiles, it ships to production, and it
            quietly defeats every seed script that assumes a topological sort
            will work.
          </p>
          <p>The planner runs in three phases:</p>
          <ol className="ml-5 list-decimal space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Introspect.</strong> Read <code>pg_catalog</code> to
              extract every table, column, FK, NOT NULL constraint, and
              DEFERRABLE status. No assumptions, no parsing of{" "}
              <code>CREATE TABLE</code> text—the source of truth is the live
              schema.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Build the DAG, find the cycles.</strong> Treat tables as
              nodes and FKs as edges. A straightforward topological sort
              handles 100% of acyclic schemas. For the remainder, Tarjan&rsquo;s
              algorithm enumerates every strongly-connected component.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Break each cycle on the weakest edge.</strong> Inside a
              cycle, pick the FK whose column is nullable (or has a DEFAULT, or
              is declared DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED). Insert that side first
              with the FK column left empty, insert the other side normally,
              then run a second pass that <code>UPDATE</code>s the empty column
              with the correct id. Referential integrity holds at every commit
              point.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            When no edge in a cycle is breakable—every column on the cycle is
            NOT NULL with no DEFAULT and not DEFERRABLE—satus refuses to guess.
            It exits with code <code>10</code> (<code>E_FK_CYCLE</code>) and
            tells you which constraint to relax. We&rsquo;d rather fail loudly
            than ship a workaround that violates an invariant you spent time
            declaring.

        <Prose>
          <p>
            Before any write, satus counts user-table rows—every table outside{" "}
            <code>pg_catalog</code>, <code>information_schema</code>, and{" "}
            <code>pg_toast</code>—and refuses to run if the total exceeds{" "}
            <strong>10,000</strong>. The intent is narrow: catch the case where
            <code> DATABASE_URL</code> was set to production by accident.
          </p>
          <p>
            10,000 is deliberately conservative. A fresh development database
            sits at zero. A Docker container with the day&rsquo;s migration
            applied sits in the low hundreds. A test database that someone
            already seeded is in the low thousands. Anything above five digits
            is almost always a database you didn&rsquo;t mean to point at.
          </p>
          <p>
            The guard is bypassable. Pass <code>--force</code> when you know
            what you&rsquo;re doing—appending to a staging database that
            already has real fixtures, for example. The exit code on a guard
            trip is <code>11</code> (<code>E_DB_NOT_EMPTY</code>) so CI can
            distinguish &ldquo;refused to run&rdquo; from &ldquo;tried and
            failed.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            Two things the guard is not: it isn&rsquo;t a permission check
            (Postgres roles do that better), and it isn&rsquo;t a rollback
            mechanism (the transaction guarantee below does that). It is one
            confirmation prompt, expressed as an exit code, between you and a
            mistake that costs a Slack apology.

          <p>
            <code>satus generate</code> opens a single Postgres transaction,
            issues every <code>INSERT</code> and the FK back-patch{" "}
            <code>UPDATE</code>s inside it, and commits exactly once at the
            end. If anything fails—an LLM timeout, an unforeseen check
            constraint, a network blip, <code>Ctrl-C</code>—the transaction
            rolls back and your database is left in the state it was in before
            the run started.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is plain Postgres ACID; we don&rsquo;t implement a custom
            rollback. The value we add is that the run <em>fits</em> in one
            transaction. The planner pre-computes the entire insert order, the
            LLM calls happen ahead of writes so token failures abort before
            anything hits the database, and the back-patch pass is small enough
            to stay inside the transaction without inflating WAL.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two practical consequences:
          </p>
          <ul className="ml-5 list-disc space-y-1">
            <li>
              You don&rsquo;t need cleanup scripts. A failed run is a no-op.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can run <code>satus generate</code> in a tight CI loop
              against the same database without worrying about half-seeded
              state from a previous run.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The trade-off: very large seed runs hold a long-lived transaction.
            For datasets above ~50,000 rows we recommend planning with{" "}
            <code>--dry</code> first and reviewing the SQL—not because the
            transaction will fail, but so you know what you&rsquo;re about to
            commit.
