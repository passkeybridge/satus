# satus

**Realistic, FK-safe seed data for Postgres.** satus reads your schema from
`pg_catalog`, sorts tables by foreign-key dependency, asks an LLM (your
OpenAI or Anthropic key) for rows that look like a real business, and
inserts them in a single all-or-nothing transaction.

```console
$ satus generate --profile ecommerce --rows 5

satus generate
  schema:   public
  profile:  ecommerce
  provider: anthropic
  model:    claude-haiku-4-5
  rows:     5 per table
  tables:   categories -> customers -> products -> orders -> order_items
  cycles:   categories.featured_product_id -> products (deferred)

  categories . 5
  customers . 5
  products . 5
  orders . 5
  order_items . 5
  wired categories.featured_product_id -> products (5 rows)

✓ inserted 25 rows across 5 tables
  tokens: 4723 in / 1054 out   spent: $0.0300
```

That transcript is real — including the FK cycle it detected, deferred, and
back-patched.

## Quickstart

```bash
npm install -g @passkeybridge/satus     # Node >= 20; or use npx

export DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/app"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."          # or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# Plan + validate offline — no LLM calls, no writes, no spend.
satus generate --profile ecommerce --dry-run

# Generate for real.
satus generate --profile ecommerce --rows 50
```

## What it actually does

- **Introspection**: one round-trip against `pg_catalog` — tables, columns,
  PKs, FKs (with deferrability), single-column uniques, enums. Partitioned
  tables are seeded via the parent, with child-declared FKs re-attributed
  to the partition root.
- **Ordering**: Kahn's topological sort over the FK graph. Soft cycles are
  broken by NULLing a nullable back-edge and back-patching it after all
  tables are seeded, inside the same transaction.
- **Generation**: batched structured-output calls (OpenAI `json_schema`,
  Anthropic tool-forcing) against a JSON schema built from your columns;
  FK values are injected from actually-inserted parent PKs, never invented.
- **Safety**: refuses to run against a database already holding more than
  10,000 rows (exit `11`, `--force` to override); one transaction per run; a `--max-cost` USD budget that
  aborts and rolls back before overshooting; `--dry-run` simulates and
  validates offline and exits non-zero on findings (CI gate).
- **Honest limits (v0.x)**: multi-column uniques are not enforced during
  generation, cross-column arithmetic is not reconciled, and output is not
  deterministic (no `--seed` — snapshot with `pg_dump` for stable fixtures).
