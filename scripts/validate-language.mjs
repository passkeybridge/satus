/**
 * Fail the build on prose that reads like it was generated rather than
 * written.
 *
 * The corpus was clean when this landed: one tell across 44 posts and every
 * site route, introduced the same morning it was found. That is the point of
 * adding the gate now rather than later — it is cheap to keep a clean corpus
 * clean, and expensive to clean one that drifted for a year.
 *
 * What it checks is the mechanical half of mem/features/house-voice.md:
 * fixed phrases with near-zero legitimate use in this repo. It cannot judge
 * whether a paragraph earns its place, and it does not try. Rhythm standing
 * in for content is a human read.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT checked, because the corpus shows they are house style
 * rather than tells: em dashes (172 of them), contractions (42), and the
 * occasional rhetorical question (49). A linter that strips those would be
 * flattening the voice it is supposed to protect.
 *
 * Escape hatch: put `<!-- voice-ok: reason -->` (or `// voice-ok: reason`
 * in a .tsx route) on the line BEFORE the flagged line. There is exactly one
 * in the corpus. If you find yourself adding a third, the pattern is wrong —
 * fix the pattern in one commit, with the reason, rather than sprinkling
 * exemptions.
